    <h3>Whats In It?</h3>
    
    <p>
        For a recipe with so few ingredients (cream cheese, eggs, sugar, sour cream, 
        vanilla & salt), it took a lot longer than you might think to develop 
        the perfect version. I’ve shared a few cheesecake variations in the 
        past, including my <a href="https://sugarspunrun.com/no-bake-cookies/">No-Bake Cheesecake</a>, but getting a perfected classic 
        version took lots of testing. Finally, here we are.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Oh, and we are skipping the water bath! I’ve always found them to be largely 
        unnecessary with cheesecakes. Cook yours on a low temperature and follow my tips 
        below and you’ll have a perfectly creamy and crack-less cheesecake without all 
        the hassle of a water bath.

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 325F (160C).
        </li>

        <li>
            Prepare Graham Cracker crust first by combining graham cracker 
            crumbs, sugar, and brown sugar, and stirring well. Add melted 
            butter and use a fork to combine ingredients well.
        </li>

        <li>
            Pour crumbs into a 9” Springform pan and press 
            firmly into the bottom and up the sides of your pan. Set aside.
        </li>

        
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Cheesecake</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a 
            hand mixer) add cream cheese and stir until smooth and 
            creamy (don’t over-beat or you’ll incorporate too much air).
        </li>

        <li>
            Add sugar and stir again until creamy.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until 
            well-combined. If using a stand mixer, make sure you 
            pause periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the 
            bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are evenly 
            incorporated.
        </li>

        <li>
            With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, 
            one at a time, stirring just until each egg is just 
            incorporated. Once all eggs have been added, use a spatula 
            to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl again and make 
            sure all ingredients are well combined.
        </li>

        <li>
            Pour cheesecake batter into prepared springform pan. 
            To insure against leaks, place pan on a cookie sheet 
            that’s been lined with foil.
        </li>

        <li>
            Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F 
            (160C) for about 75 minutes. Edges will likely have 
            slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn a light 
            golden brown and the center should spring back to the touch 
            but will still be Jello-jiggly. Don't over-bake or the 
            texture will suffer, which means we all suffer.
        </li>

        <li>
            Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven 
            for 10 minutes. Once 10 minutes has passed, use a knife to gently 
            loosen the crust from the inside of the springform pan 
            (this will help prevent cracks as your cheesecake cools and shrinks).
        </li>

        <li>
            Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near 
            room temperature before transferring to refrigerator and 
            allowing to cool overnight or at least 6 hours. Enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
