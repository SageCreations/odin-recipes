    <h3>Whats In It?</h3>
    
    <p>
        The Edward Cruz Original, named after myself because why not, came 
        from me expiermenting with what I could make while on the Ideal Protien 
        Diet Protocol. This diet only lets me eat certain foods and use certain 
        seasonings with my meals and at the time my meat intake was limited to 
        4-6 oz. This recipe I've concocted is in <strong>my opinion</strong> 
        restuarant grade food when ever you can only eat meat for dinner and 
        vegteables mainly through out the day.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The Noodles you can see in the pictures are noodle knots but not your 
        typical type of noodle. The noodles in this dish are made of Konjac, 
        jelly like substance when seen in solid chunks but you can get them 
        at stores in the forms of rice or noodles. Konjac is mainly made out 
        of water and the rest is fiber, the calorie count for an entire 
        pack is around <em>10 cals.</em> The fiber the noodle is made out of also
        helps with lowering the horomone in the body that results in you 
        feeling hungry which is why it has a super filling effect after eating.

            what you chose from the list and throw in the olive oil 
            and Chili garlic sauce (if applicable) at this stage as well.

        <li>
            Once the meat looks cooked on both sides go ahead and throw in the veggies
            to cook with the meat and they'll absorb all the meat juices too.
        </li>

        <li>
            While you wait for everything to finish cooking in the pan, you 
            should prep the bowl with the noodles/noodle knots with the 
            Kewpie mayo.
